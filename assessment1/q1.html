    The sun has set, the day is done,
    The stars appear, one by one.
    A gentle breeze begins to blow,
    As night unfolds its peaceful glow.

    The moonlight dances on the lake,
    Reflecting dreams that softly wake.
    In this quiet, tranquil place,
    I find my heartâ€™s most sacred space.
